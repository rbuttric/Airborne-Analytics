# Airline Delay Prediction and Airport Demand Forecasting
## Overview
Airline flight demand forecasting is a critical aspect of the aviation industry, influencing decisions across various operational dimensions. From strategic route expansion to optimizing staffing levels, accurate forecasting empowers airlines with insights to navigate the dynamic landscape of air travel.

This project is dedicated to predicting airline delays and forecasting airport demand, with a focus on providing valuable information for consumers booking future flights. Our model aims to empower passengers by offering relevant statistics and graphs related to their selected departure airport and date. Users can input their preferred departure date and airport, and the model will generate insights into historical and forecasted traffic patterns. This data can assist passengers in making informed decisions about arrival times, exploring alternative dates with lower demand, or anticipating potential delays due to high traffic volumes.

## Key Features
- User-Friendly Interface: Our model provides a straightforward interface where users can input their desired departure date and airport to receive tailored insights.
- Historical and Forecasted Data: Users gain access to both historical and forecasted traffic patterns, aiding in decision-making for future flights.
- Peace of Mind for Passengers: By predicting departure delays, the model helps passengers plan their itineraries more effectively and reduces the stress associated with potential delays.
- Focused Analysis on United Airlines: The analysis centers on the domestic flight records of United Airlines for the year 2018.

## How It Works
- User Input: Users input their preferred departure date and airport.
- Data Analysis: The model analyzes historical flight data, providing insights into past traffic patterns.
- Forecasting: Using advanced forecasting techniques, the model predicts future demand and potential delays.
- Visualizations: Relevant statistics and graphs are generated, offering users a clear understanding of the patterns and trends.

## Why It Matters
- Informed Decision-Making: Passengers can make informed decisions about their travel plans based on historical and forecasted data.
- Stress Reduction: Predicting departure delays provides passengers with peace of mind and the ability to proactively adjust their itineraries.
- Strategic Insights for Airlines: Airlines can use demand forecasting to optimize operations, enhance route planning, and improve overall efficiency.
